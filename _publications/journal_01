ABSTRACT
Brain electrical activity commonly represented by the Electroencephalogram
(EEG), due to its miniscule amplitude (on the order of a hundred microvolts), is often
contaminated with various artifacts. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) may be a useful
technique to reduce some artifacts prior analyzing EEG. Present report discusses use of
kurtosis to determine the threshold for detecting the artifacts-related independent components.
Kurtosis may represent how peaked or how flat the artifacts that affect a signal are compared
to the normal behavior of the original signal. Two statistical approaches were used for the
kurtosis-based threshold selection: the Z-score and the confidence interval. The independent
components determined as artifact-related may be either set to zero for the greater artifact
suppression or scaled down for the reduced effect on the artifact-free regions of EEG.
Based on the observed results, we may conclude that the present technique may be used for
ocular artifacts reduction in EEG.
